**Select a PDF File to Encrypt:** The application uses a sample PDF document ([Sample.pdf](https://github.com/aspose-free-consulting/projects/files/5263493/Sample.pdf)) which is also available in the project but, you can use any PDF document.

**Specify Privileges and Password:** This section would allow you to specify password for the PDF and different privileges options as per your needs.
