# Create TOC in Existing PDF by Extracting Page Titles
This [free consulting project](https://aspose-free-consulting.github.io/) uses [Aspose.PDF](https://products.aspose.com/pdf) to enable you to [create TOC in exisiting PDF document](https://docs.aspose.com/display/pdfnet/Manipulate+PDF+Document#ManipulatePDFDocument-AddTOCtoExistingPDF) by [extracting first line/phrase of each page](https://docs.aspose.com/display/pdfnet/Extract+Text+from+PDF). It also showcases a functionality to extract lengthy content pages and create a separate PDF document from them. For example, if a Chapter has title "Chapter 1" and it expands over more than one page of the PDF, this utility will extract all pages containing "Chapter 1" title and create a new PDF file from them.
